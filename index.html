                when you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way
                it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world.
                try not to bash into the walls too much. try to have a nice
                family life, have fun, save a little money. that's a very
                limited life. life can be much broader once you discover one
                simple fact: everything around you that you call life was made
                up by people that were no smarter than you. and you can change
                it, you can influence it… once you learn that, you'll never be
                the same again.

                the separation of talent and skill is one of the greatest
                misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel, who
                have dreams, who want to do things. talent you have naturally.
                skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating
                on your craft.<br /><br />
                i've never really viewed myself as particularly talented. where
                i excel is ridiculous, sickening work ethic. you know, while the
                other guy's sleeping, i'm working. while the other guy's eating,
                i'm working.<br /><br />
                there's no easy way around it. no matter how talented you are,
                your talent is going to fail you if you're not skilled. if you
                don't study, if you don't work really hard and dedicate yourself
                to being better every single day, you'll never be able to
                communicate with people – with your artistry – the way that you
                want.<br /><br />
                the only thing that i see that is distinctly different about me
                is: i'm not afraid to die on a treadmill. you might have more
                talent than me; you might be smarter than me. but if we get on a
                treadmill together, there's two things: you're getting off
                first, or i'm gonna die.<br /><br />
                it's really that simple.

                fearlessness means taking the first step, even if you don’t know
                where it will take you. it means being driven by a higher
                purpose, rather than by applause. it means knowing that you
                reveal your character when you stand apart, more than when you
                stand with the crowd.

                when i was a little kid, i was really scared of the dark. but
                then i came to understand, dark just means the absence of
                photons in the visible wavelength--400 to 700 nanometers. then i
                thought, well, it's really silly to be afraid of a lack of
                photons. then i wasn't afraid of the dark anymore after that.
