      When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life
      inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little
      money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around
      you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can
      influence it… Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.

      The separation of talent and skill is one of the
      greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are
      trying to excel, who have dreams, who want to do
      things. Talent you have naturally. Skill is only
      developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on
      your craft.</br></br>
      I’ve never really viewed myself as particularly
      talented. Where I excel is ridiculous, sickening
      work ethic. You know, while the other guy’s
      sleeping, I’m working. While the other guy’s eating,
      I’m working.</br></br>
      There’s no easy way around it. No matter how
      talented you are, your talent is going to fail you
      if you’re not skilled. If you don’t study, if you
      don’t work really hard and dedicate yourself to
      being better every single day, you’ll never be able
      to communicate with people – with your artistry –
      the way that you want.</br></br>
      The only thing that I see that is distinctly
      different about me is: I’m not afraid to die on a
      treadmill. You might have more talent than me; you
      might be smarter than me. But if we get on a
      treadmill together, there’s two things: you’re
      getting off first, or I’m gonna die.</br></br>
      It’s really that simple.
